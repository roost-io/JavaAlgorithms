Based on the provided method and class information, here are several test scenarios for the `determinant` method in the `HillCipher` class:

Scenario 1: Calculate Determinant of 1x1 Matrix

Details:
  TestName: determinantOf1x1Matrix
  Description: Verify that the determinant of a 1x1 matrix is correctly calculated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 1x1 matrix with a single value.
  Act: Call the determinant method with the 1x1 matrix.
  Assert: Verify that the returned determinant matches the single value in the matrix.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the base case of the determinant calculation for a 1x1 matrix is correct. It's crucial for the recursive algorithm to work properly.

Scenario 2: Calculate Determinant of 2x2 Matrix

Details:
  TestName: determinantOf2x2Matrix
  Description: Verify that the determinant of a 2x2 matrix is correctly calculated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2x2 matrix with known values.
  Act: Call the determinant method with the 2x2 matrix.
  Assert: Compare the returned determinant with the manually calculated expected value.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method can correctly calculate the determinant of a 2x2 matrix, which is a fundamental case for larger matrices.

Scenario 3: Calculate Determinant of 3x3 Matrix

Details:
  TestName: determinantOf3x3Matrix
  Description: Verify that the determinant of a 3x3 matrix is correctly calculated.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 3x3 matrix with known values.
  Act: Call the determinant method with the 3x3 matrix.
  Assert: Compare the returned determinant with the manually calculated expected value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the recursive algorithm works correctly for a matrix larger than 2x2, testing the core logic of the method.

Scenario 4: Calculate Determinant of Matrix with Zero Determinant

Details:
  TestName: determinantOfMatrixWithZeroDeterminant
  Description: Verify that the method correctly calculates a zero determinant for a singular matrix.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a matrix that is known to have a zero determinant (e.g., a matrix with a row or column of all zeros).
  Act: Call the determinant method with this matrix.
  Assert: Verify that the returned determinant is zero.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method can correctly identify and calculate the determinant of a singular matrix, which is important for the Hill Cipher's key validation.

Scenario 5: Calculate Determinant of Large Matrix

Details:
  TestName: determinantOfLargeMatrix
  Description: Verify that the method can handle and correctly calculate the determinant of a large matrix (e.g., 5x5 or larger).
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a large matrix (e.g., 5x5) with known values and a pre-calculated determinant.
  Act: Call the determinant method with this large matrix.
  Assert: Compare the returned determinant with the pre-calculated expected value.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the recursive algorithm can handle larger matrices without stack overflow or significant performance issues, which is important for scalability.

Scenario 6: Calculate Determinant of Matrix with Negative Values

Details:
  TestName: determinantOfMatrixWithNegativeValues
  Description: Verify that the method correctly calculates the determinant when the matrix contains negative values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a matrix that includes negative values with a known determinant.
  Act: Call the determinant method with this matrix.
  Assert: Compare the returned determinant with the expected value.
Validation:
  This test checks if the method handles negative values correctly, ensuring it works for all types of integer inputs.

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `determinant` method, including different matrix sizes, special cases (like zero determinant), and matrices with different types of values. They aim to ensure the correctness and robustness of the determinant calculation, which is crucial for the Hill Cipher implementation.
