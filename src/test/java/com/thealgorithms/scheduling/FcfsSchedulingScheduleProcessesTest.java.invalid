Based on the provided information and instructions, here are some test scenarios for the `scheduleProcesses()` method of the `FCFSScheduling` entity:

```
Scenario 1: Schedule Processes with Multiple Processes

Details:
  TestName: scheduleProcessesWithMultipleProcesses
  Description: Verify that the scheduleProcesses method correctly calculates waiting time and turnaround time for multiple processes.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an FCFSScheduling instance with a list of multiple ProcessDetails objects.
  Act: Call the scheduleProcesses method.
  Assert: Verify that the waiting time and turnaround time for each process are correctly calculated.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the scheduleProcesses method correctly evaluates waiting time and turnaround time for multiple processes. It's crucial to verify that the FCFS scheduling algorithm is working as expected for a typical use case with multiple processes.

Scenario 2: Schedule Processes with Empty Process List

Details:
  TestName: scheduleProcessesWithEmptyList
  Description: Verify that the scheduleProcesses method handles an empty process list gracefully.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an FCFSScheduling instance with an empty list of processes.
  Act: Call the scheduleProcesses method.
  Assert: Verify that no exceptions are thrown and the method completes successfully.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the scheduleProcesses method can handle edge cases, such as an empty process list, without throwing exceptions or causing errors. It's important to verify that the method behaves correctly in such scenarios to prevent potential runtime errors.

Scenario 3: Schedule Processes with Single Process

Details:
  TestName: scheduleProcessesWithSingleProcess
  Description: Verify that the scheduleProcesses method correctly calculates waiting time and turnaround time for a single process.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an FCFSScheduling instance with a list containing only one ProcessDetails object.
  Act: Call the scheduleProcesses method.
  Assert: Verify that the waiting time is 0 and the turnaround time equals the burst time for the single process.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the scheduleProcesses method correctly handles the case of a single process, where the waiting time should be 0 and the turnaround time should equal the burst time. It's important to verify this edge case to ensure the algorithm works correctly for all scenarios.

Scenario 4: Schedule Processes with Large Number of Processes

Details:
  TestName: scheduleProcessesWithLargeNumberOfProcesses
  Description: Verify that the scheduleProcesses method can handle a large number of processes without performance issues.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create an FCFSScheduling instance with a list containing a large number of ProcessDetails objects (e.g., 10000).
  Act: Call the scheduleProcesses method and measure the execution time.
  Assert: Verify that the method completes within an acceptable time frame and correctly calculates waiting time and turnaround time for all processes.

Validation:
  This test ensures that the scheduleProcesses method can handle a large number of processes efficiently. It's important to verify that the algorithm scales well and doesn't suffer from performance degradation with a high volume of processes, which could be encountered in real-world scenarios.
```

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `scheduleProcesses()` method, including normal operation, edge cases, and performance considerations. They aim to ensure that the FCFS scheduling algorithm is implemented correctly and can handle different scenarios robustly.
