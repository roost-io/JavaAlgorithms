Based on the provided information, here are several test scenarios for the `sortByArrivalTime()` method in the `SJFScheduling` class:

Scenario 1: Sort an empty list of processes

Details:
  TestName: emptyProcessList
  Description: Verify that the method handles an empty list of processes without throwing exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an SJFScheduling instance with an empty list of processes.
  Act: Call the sortByArrivalTime() method.
  Assert: Verify that the list remains empty after sorting.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method gracefully handles edge cases, specifically an empty list, without causing errors or exceptions.

Scenario 2: Sort a list with one process

Details:
  TestName: singleProcessList
  Description: Check if the method correctly handles a list containing only one process.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an SJFScheduling instance with a single ProcessDetails object.
  Act: Call the sortByArrivalTime() method.
  Assert: Verify that the list remains unchanged after sorting.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method works correctly for the minimal case of a single-element list, ensuring no unnecessary operations are performed.

Scenario 3: Sort a list with processes in ascending arrival time order

Details:
  TestName: alreadySortedProcessList
  Description: Verify that the method maintains the order of processes already sorted by arrival time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an SJFScheduling instance with multiple ProcessDetails objects sorted by ascending arrival time.
  Act: Call the sortByArrivalTime() method.
  Assert: Verify that the order of processes remains unchanged after sorting.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method doesn't unnecessarily modify an already sorted list, which is important for efficiency.

Scenario 4: Sort a list with processes in descending arrival time order

Details:
  TestName: reverseSortedProcessList
  Description: Check if the method correctly sorts processes that are initially in descending order of arrival time.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an SJFScheduling instance with multiple ProcessDetails objects sorted by descending arrival time.
  Act: Call the sortByArrivalTime() method.
  Assert: Verify that the processes are now sorted in ascending order of arrival time.
Validation:
  This test confirms that the method can handle the worst-case scenario of a completely reverse-sorted list and correctly reorder it.

Scenario 5: Sort a list with processes having duplicate arrival times

Details:
  TestName: duplicateArrivalTimeProcessList
  Description: Verify that the method correctly handles processes with identical arrival times.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an SJFScheduling instance with multiple ProcessDetails objects, some having the same arrival time.
  Act: Call the sortByArrivalTime() method.
  Assert: Verify that processes with the same arrival time maintain their relative order, and the overall list is sorted by arrival time.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the sorting algorithm is stable for processes with equal arrival times, which is important for maintaining consistency in scheduling.

Scenario 6: Sort a large list of processes

Details:
  TestName: largeProcessList
  Description: Check the method's performance and correctness when sorting a large number of processes.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an SJFScheduling instance with a large number of ProcessDetails objects (e.g., 1000) with random arrival times.
  Act: Call the sortByArrivalTime() method.
  Assert: Verify that all processes are sorted in ascending order of arrival time.
Validation:
  This test verifies the method's efficiency and correctness when dealing with a large dataset, which is crucial for real-world scenarios with many processes.

Note: These test scenarios focus on the `sortByArrivalTime()` method and use only the information provided about the `SJFScheduling` class and its methods. The scenarios do not assume the existence of any getter or setter methods that were not explicitly mentioned in the provided information.

/*
The test is failing because the sorting algorithm in the `sortByArrivalTime()` method is not correctly sorting the processes based on their arrival time. 

The error message shows:

```
org.opentest4j.AssertionFailedError: expected: <0> but was: <2>
```

This indicates that the test expected the arrival time of the first process (index 0) to be 0, but it was actually 2. 

The issue is in the `sortByArrivalTime()` method. The current implementation has a few problems:

1. The inner loop is not iterating through all elements. It should be `j < size` instead of `j < size - 1`.
2. The comparison is in the wrong direction. It should be `<` instead of `>` to sort in ascending order.

As a result, the method is not properly sorting the processes, and the test is failing because the processes are still in their original order (2, 1, 0) instead of being sorted by arrival time (0, 1, 2).

To fix this, the `sortByArrivalTime()` method needs to be corrected to properly implement the bubble sort algorithm for ascending order. Once fixed, the test should pass as it correctly checks if the processes are sorted by arrival time in ascending order.

/*
The test is failing due to an issue in the sortByArrivalTime() method implementation. The assertion that checks if the processes are sorted by arrival time is failing, indicating that the sorting is not being performed correctly.

The problem lies in the inner loop of the sortByArrivalTime() method. The loop condition is incorrect, causing it to skip the last element in the list. The current implementation is:

for (j = i + 1; j < size - 1; j++)

This condition should be changed to:

for (j = i + 1; j < size; j++)

Because of this error, the last element in the list is never compared or swapped, leading to an incorrectly sorted list. In the test case with 1000 processes, this results in the last process potentially being out of order, causing the assertion to fail.

The test creates a large list of processes with arrival times in descending order (999 to 0), so after sorting, they should be in ascending order (0 to 999). The assertion checks that each process's arrival time is less than or equal to the next one's. Since the sorting is not complete due to the loop condition error, this assertion fails for at least one pair of adjacent processes.

To fix this issue, the loop condition in the sortByArrivalTime() method needs to be corrected to include the last element in the comparison and swapping process.
