Here are the test scenarios for the `addEdge` method:

**Scenario 1: Adding an Edge to an Empty Adjacency List**

Details:  
TestName: addEdgeToEmptyAdjacencyList
Description: This test checks if an edge can be added to an empty adjacency list.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize an empty adjacency list using the `initAdjList` method.
Act: Call the `addEdge` method to add an edge from vertex 0 to vertex 1.
Assert: Verify that the adjacency list at index 0 contains vertex 1.

Validation: 
This test verifies that the `addEdge` method can successfully add an edge to an empty adjacency list. This is a basic functionality of the method and is essential for building the graph.

**Scenario 2: Adding Multiple Edges to the Same Source Vertex**

Details:  
TestName: addMultipleEdgesToSameSourceVertex
Description: This test checks if multiple edges can be added to the same source vertex.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize an empty adjacency list using the `initAdjList` method.
Act: Call the `addEdge` method to add edges from vertex 0 to vertices 1 and 2.
Assert: Verify that the adjacency list at index 0 contains both vertices 1 and 2.

Validation: 
This test verifies that the `addEdge` method can successfully add multiple edges to the same source vertex. This is an important feature of the method, as it allows for the creation of complex graphs.

**Scenario 3: Adding an Edge to a Non-Empty Adjacency List**

Details:  
TestName: addEdgeToNonEmptyAdjacencyList
Description: This test checks if an edge can be added to a non-empty adjacency list.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize an adjacency list with an existing edge using the `initAdjList` and `addEdge` methods.
Act: Call the `addEdge` method to add a new edge from vertex 0 to vertex 2.
Assert: Verify that the adjacency list at index 0 contains both the existing edge and the new edge.

Validation: 
This test verifies that the `addEdge` method can successfully add an edge to a non-empty adjacency list. This is an important feature of the method, as it allows for the incremental construction of graphs.

**Scenario 4: Adding an Edge with Invalid Source Vertex**

Details:  
TestName: addEdgeWithInvalidSourceVertex
Description: This test checks if the `addEdge` method handles invalid source vertices correctly.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize an empty adjacency list using the `initAdjList` method.
Act: Call the `addEdge` method with an invalid source vertex (e.g., -1).
Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown or an error is reported.

Validation: 
This test verifies that the `addEdge` method correctly handles invalid source vertices. This is an important aspect of error handling and ensures that the method behaves correctly in unexpected situations.

**Scenario 5: Adding an Edge with Invalid Destination Vertex**

Details:  
TestName: addEdgeWithInvalidDestinationVertex
Description: This test checks if the `addEdge` method handles invalid destination vertices correctly.

Execution:
Arrange: Initialize an empty adjacency list using the `initAdjList` method.
Act: Call the `addEdge` method with an invalid destination vertex (e.g., -1).
Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown or an error is reported.

Validation: 
This test verifies that the `addEdge` method correctly handles invalid destination vertices. This is an important aspect of error handling and ensures that the method behaves correctly in unexpected situations.

/*
The test is failing because it is expecting a `NullPointerException` to be thrown when calling `graph.addEdge(0, -1)`, but no exception is being thrown. This is because the `addEdge` method does not perform any null checks or validation on its input parameters. It simply attempts to add the edge to the adjacency list, which in this case is not null.

The reason for this expectation is likely that the test is trying to cover the scenario where an invalid destination vertex is passed to the `addEdge` method. However, since the method does not check for invalid input, no exception is thrown, and the test fails.

To fix this test, the `addEdge` method should be modified to throw an exception when an invalid destination vertex is passed. For example, it could throw an `IllegalArgumentException` when the destination vertex is less than 0.

Additionally, there are some warnings in the build log about duplicate plugin declarations and unchecked operations. These warnings should be addressed to ensure the build is stable and free of potential issues. 

However, the primary reason for the test failure is the missing input validation in the `addEdge` method.
@Test

    AllPathsFromSourceToTarget graph = new AllPathsFromSourceToTarget(2);
    // This test case may not throw NullPointerException as expected,
    // because addEdge method does not check for null before adding edge.
    // Consider adding null check in the addEdge method.
    assertThrows(NullPointerException.class, () -> graph.addEdge(0, -1));
