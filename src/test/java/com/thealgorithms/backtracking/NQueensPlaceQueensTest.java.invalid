Scenario 1: Test for placing one queen on the board

Details:  
    TestName: testPlaceOneQueen.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the program correctly places one queen on a 1x1 board. Since it is possible to place one queen on a 1x1 board, the function should return a list of arrangements with one arrangement. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the number of queens to be 1.
    Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with the number of queens as 1.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the arrangements list contains exactly one arrangement.
Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that one queen can be placed on a 1x1 board. The expected result is based on the logic that a single queen can be placed on a board of any size.

Scenario 2: Test for placing two queens on the board

Details:  
    TestName: testPlaceTwoQueens.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the program correctly places two queens on a 2x2 board. Since it is not possible to place two queens on a 2x2 board without them attacking each other, the function should return an empty list of arrangements.
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the number of queens to be 2.
    Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with the number of queens as 2.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the arrangements list is empty.
Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that two queens cannot be placed on a 2x2 board without them attacking each other. The expected result is based on the logic that it is not possible to place two queens on a 2x2 board without them attacking each other.

Scenario 3: Test for placing four queens on the board

Details:  
    TestName: testPlaceFourQueens.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the program correctly places four queens on a 4x4 board. Since it is possible to place four queens on a 4x4 board without them attacking each other, the function should return a list of arrangements with two arrangements. 
Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the number of queens to be 4.
    Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with the number of queens as 4.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the arrangements list contains exactly two arrangements.
Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that four queens can be placed on a 4x4 board without them attacking each other. The expected result is based on the logic that there are two different ways to place four queens on a 4x4 board without them attacking each other.
