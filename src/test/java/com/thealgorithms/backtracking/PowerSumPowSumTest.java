"""
Scenario 1: Test powSum with positive integer parameters

Details:  
  TestName: testPowSumWithPositiveIntegers
  Description: This test checks the powSum method with positive integer parameters to verify the correct calculation of the power sum.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any state.
  Act: Invoke powSum method with positive integer parameters, for example, powSum(10, 2).
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the powSum method correctly calculates the sum of powers of numbers up to 'n'. The expected result is based on the mathematical power sum calculation. This is significant in validating the primary function of the powSum method.

Scenario 2: Test powSum with zero as parameters

Details:  
  TestName: testPowSumWithZero
  Description: This test checks the powSum method with zero as parameters to verify the correct handling of this edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any state.
  Act: Invoke powSum method with zero as parameters, for example, powSum(0, 0).
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the powSum method correctly handles the edge case of zero parameters. The expected result is zero, as the sum of zero to any power is zero. This is significant in validating the robustness of the powSum method.

Scenario 3: Test powSum with negative integer parameters

Details:  
  TestName: testPowSumWithNegativeIntegers
  Description: This test checks the powSum method with negative integer parameters to verify the correct handling of such inputs.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any state.
  Act: Invoke powSum method with negative integer parameters, for example, powSum(-5, -2).
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the powSum method correctly handles negative integer parameters. The expected result is undefined, as the power sum of negative numbers is not clearly defined. This is significant in validating the robustness of the powSum method.
  
Scenario 4: Test powSum with 'n' less than 'x'

Details:  
  TestName: testPowSumWithNLessThanX
  Description: This test checks the powSum method with 'n' less than 'x' to verify the correct computation in such scenarios.
Execution:
  Arrange: No setup required as the method does not depend on any state.
  Act: Invoke powSum method with 'n' less than 'x', for example, powSum(2, 5).
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the powSum method correctly calculates the power sum when 'n' is less than 'x'. The expected result is based on the mathematical power sum calculation. This is significant in validating the behavior of the powSum method in such scenarios.
