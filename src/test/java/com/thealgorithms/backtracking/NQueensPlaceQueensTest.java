================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If the 'getSolution' function uses random values that are not sufficiently random, it may be possible for an attacker to predict the output.
Solution: Consider using a strong source of randomness. For instance, 'java.security.SecureRandom' could be used instead of 'java.util.Random'.

Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Information about the internal state of the application (e.g., the number of queens and the size of the board) is exposed via 'System.out.println', which could provide useful information to an attacker.
Solution: Avoid exposing sensitive information in log files or console outputs. If you need to debug, consider using a proper logging mechanism with different log levels.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The 'queens' parameter is not validated before use. If a negative number or a very large number is passed, it could result in unexpected behavior or even a potential Denial of Service (DoS) attack.
Solution: Always validate function parameters. In this case, ensure that 'queens' is a positive integer and within an acceptable range.

"""
Scenario 1: Test for placing one queen on the board

Details:  
    TestName: testPlaceOneQueen.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the program correctly places one queen on a 1x1 board. Since it is possible to place one queen on a 1x1 board, we expect the program to provide a solution.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the board size to 1.
    Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with 1 as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the arrangements list is not empty.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the program can correctly place one queen on a 1x1 board. This is significant because it tests the program's basic functionality and its ability to handle the simplest case.

Scenario 2: Test for placing two queens on the board

Details:  
    TestName: testPlaceTwoQueens.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the program correctly handles a case where it is impossible to place the queens. Since it is impossible to place two queens on a 2x2 board without them attacking each other, we expect the program to return no solutions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the board size to 2.
    Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with 2 as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the arrangements list is empty.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the program correctly handles cases where it is impossible to place the queens. This is significant because it tests the program's error handling and its ability to handle edge cases.

Scenario 3: Test for placing four queens on the board

Details:  
    TestName: testPlaceFourQueens.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the program correctly places four queens on a 4x4 board. Since it is possible to place four queens on a 4x4 board without them attacking each other, we expect the program to provide a solution.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the board size to 4.
    Act: Invoke the placeQueens method with 4 as the parameter.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the arrangements list is not empty.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the program can correctly place four queens on a 4x4 board. This is significant because it tests the program's functionality in a more complex scenario.
