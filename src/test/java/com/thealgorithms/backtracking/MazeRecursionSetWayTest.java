""""
Scenario 1: Test for valid path in the maze with no obstacles

Details:  
TestName: testValidPathNoObstacles
Description: This test is meant to check if the path is valid when there is no obstacles in the maze. 
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a 2-dimensional array with no obstacles (i.e., only walls and open path).
Act: Invoke the setWay method with the appropriate parameters (the maze, and the coordinates of the starting point).
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which is true.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the ball can find its way in the maze when there is no obstacles. The expected result is true, meaning that a path is found. This test is significant in the context of application behavior as it checks the basic functionality of the path finding algorithm.

Scenario 2: Test for invalid path with obstacles blocking the way

Details:  
TestName: testInvalidPathWithObstacles
Description: This test is meant to check if the path is invalid when there are obstacles blocking the way in the maze.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a 2-dimensional array with obstacles blocking the way to the end point.
Act: Invoke the setWay method with the appropriate parameters (the maze, and the coordinates of the starting point).
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which is false.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the ball cannot find its way in the maze when the path is blocked by obstacles. The expected result is false, meaning that a path is not found. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the path finding algorithm when faced with obstacles.

Scenario 3: Test for valid path with obstacles but a way around

Details:  
TestName: testValidPathWithObstacles
Description: This test is meant to check if the path is valid when there are obstacles in the maze but there is a way around it.
Execution:
Arrange: Set up a 2-dimensional array with obstacles but a way around to the end point.
Act: Invoke the setWay method with the appropriate parameters (the maze, and the coordinates of the starting point).
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which is true.
Validation: 
The assertion verifies that the ball can find its way in the maze when there are obstacles but a way around it. The expected result is true, meaning that a path is found. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the path finding algorithm when faced with obstacles but there is a way around.
