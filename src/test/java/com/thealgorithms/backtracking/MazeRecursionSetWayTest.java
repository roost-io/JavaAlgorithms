Scenario 1: Test when the ball has found a path in the maze

Details:  
  TestName: testBallFoundPath.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly returns true when the ball has found a path in the maze. The target scenario is when map[6][5] == 2, which indicates that the ball has found a path. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a 2D maze array with map[6][5] set to 2.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the initialized maze and any coordinates.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns true.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies when the ball has found a path in the maze. The expected result is true because according to the method's logic, if map[6][5] == 2, the ball has found a path and the method should return true. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to correctly identify a successful path in the maze.

Scenario 2: Test when the ball hasn't gone through a point and can't find a path

Details:  
  TestName: testBallHasntGoneThroughPointAndCantFindPath.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly returns false when the ball hasn't gone through a point and can't find a path. The target scenario is when the ball follows the move strategy but can't find a feasible path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a 2D maze array with obstacles that prevent the ball from finding a path.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the initialized maze and the starting coordinates.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies when the ball can't find a path in the maze. The expected result is false because according to the method's logic, if the ball can't find a path after following the move strategy, the method should return false. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to correctly identify an unsuccessful path in the maze.

Scenario 3: Test when the ball hits a wall or a path it has gone through before

Details:  
  TestName: testBallHitsWallOrGoneThroughPath.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly returns false when the ball hits a wall or a path it has gone through before. The target scenario is when map[i][j] != 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a 2D maze array with map[i][j] set to 1, 2 or 3.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the initialized maze and the coordinates i, j.
  Assert: Assert that the method returns false.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies when the ball hits a wall, a path it has gone through before or a dead end. The expected result is false because according to the method's logic, if map[i][j] != 0, the method should return false. This test is significant as it checks the method's ability to correctly handle these scenarios in the maze.
