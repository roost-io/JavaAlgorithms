Scenario 1: Test to validate if edge is added successfully between two vertices.

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEdgeSuccessfully.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the edge is added successfully between two vertices in the graph. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices. 
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method with two vertices as parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the adjacency list of the first vertex against an expected list containing the second vertex.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the second vertex is present in the adjacency list of the first vertex, confirming that the edge has been added successfully. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the addEdge method.

Scenario 2: Test to validate if addEdge handles invalid vertices.

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEdgeWithInvalidVertices.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the addEdge method handles the case where one or both vertices are invalid (out of range). 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices. 
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method with one or two vertices that are out of range as parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an exception.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that an exception is thrown when attempting to add an edge with invalid vertices, ensuring that the method correctly handles this error case.

Scenario 3: Test to validate if addEdge behaves correctly with self-loops.

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEdgeWithSelfLoops.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the addEdge method correctly handles the case where a vertex is connected to itself (self-loop). 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices. 
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method with the same vertex as both parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the adjacency list of the vertex against an expected list containing the vertex itself.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the vertex is present in its own adjacency list, confirming that the self-loop has been added. This test checks whether the method correctly handles self-loops, which are a valid case in certain types of graphs.
  
Scenario 4: Test to validate if addEdge behaves correctly with multiple edges.

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEdgeWithMultipleEdges.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the addEdge method correctly handles the case where multiple edges are added between the same pair of vertices. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices. 
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method multiple times with the same pair of vertices as parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the adjacency list of the first vertex against an expected list containing multiple instances of the second vertex.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that multiple instances of the second vertex are present in the adjacency list of the first vertex, confirming that multiple edges have been added. This test checks whether the method correctly handles multiple edges, which are a valid case in certain types of graphs.
