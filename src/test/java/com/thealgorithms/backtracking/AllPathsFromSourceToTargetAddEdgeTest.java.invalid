"================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-129: Improper Validation of Array Index
Issue: The function addEdge(int u, int v) doesn't validate the array indices 'u'. It can lead to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if 'u' is not a valid index of the array 'adjList'. This can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, where an attacker can crash the application by providing invalid index.
Solution: Always validate the array indices before using them. Use an if condition to check if the index 'u' is within the valid range of the array 'adjList'.

Vulnerability: CWE-120: Classic Buffer Overflow
Issue: The function addEdge(int u, int v) may lead to buffer overflow if the ArrayList at adjList[u] exceeds its maximum capacity. This can lead to memory corruption and unexpected application behavior.
Solution: Always check the capacity of ArrayList before adding elements to it. Use the ensureCapacity() method of ArrayList to ensure that the ArrayList can accommodate the new element.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The function addEdge(int u, int v) doesn't check if adjList[u] is null before calling the add method on it. This can lead to NullPointerException, causing the application to crash.
Solution: Always check if an object is null before calling methods on it. Use an if condition to check if adjList[u] is null before calling the add method.

================================================================================
"""
Scenario 1: Test to validate if edge is added successfully between two vertices.

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEdgeSuccessfully.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the edge is added successfully between two vertices in the graph. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices. 
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method with two vertices as parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the adjacency list of the first vertex against an expected list containing the second vertex.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the second vertex is present in the adjacency list of the first vertex, confirming that the edge has been added successfully. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the addEdge method.

Scenario 2: Test to validate if addEdge handles invalid vertices.

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEdgeWithInvalidVertices.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the addEdge method handles the case when invalid or out-of-range vertices are provided as parameters. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices. 
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method with two vertices, where at least one vertex is out of range. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown, indicating that the vertices provided are invalid. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the addEdge method.

Scenario 3: Test to validate if addEdge handles multiple edges between same vertices.

Details:  
  TestName: testAddEdgeMultipleTimesBetweenSameVertices.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the addEdge method handles the case when multiple edges are added between the same vertices. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a certain number of vertices. 
  Act: Invoke the addEdge method multiple times with the same pair of vertices as parameters. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the adjacency list of the first vertex against an expected list containing the second vertex only once.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the adjacency list of the first vertex contains the second vertex only once, indicating that multiple edges between the same vertices are not allowed. This test is significant as it checks the functionality of the addEdge method in case of multiple invocations with the same parameters.
