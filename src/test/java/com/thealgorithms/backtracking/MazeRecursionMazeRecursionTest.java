================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-676: Use of Potentially Dangerous Function
Issue: The System.arraycopy() function can lead to issues if not used correctly, potentially resulting in an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Solution: Ensure the source and destination arrays are of the same size and that the source index, destination index and length parameters are correctly calculated to prevent going out of bounds.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The setWay() and setWay2() functions' parameters are not validated. If provided with invalid coordinates, this can lead to unpredictable behavior or exceptions.
Solution: Perform input validation on the parameters to ensure they fall within the expected range of values.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: If the map creation process is used in a context where randomness is required (e.g., for a game), the use of hardcoded values for the map creation can be predictable and exploitable.
Solution: If randomness is required, use a secure random number generator to determine the placement of walls and obstacles.

""" 
Scenario 1: Testing mazeRecursion with a default initialized maze and verifying the path

Details:  
  TestName: testDefaultMazePath.
  Description: This test checks the mazeRecursion() method for the default initialized maze and verifies if the path is correctly set by the setWay() and setWay2() methods.
Execution:
  Arrange: No arrangement is required as the method does not take any parameters.
  Act: Invoke the mazeRecursion method.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the final map with the expected map.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the path has been correctly set by the setWay() and setWay2() methods. This is important to ensure the correct functioning of the maze navigation logic.

Scenario 2: Testing the setWay method with a custom maze

Details:  
  TestName: testSetWayCustomMaze.
  Description: This test checks the setWay() method with a custom maze to verify if the path is correctly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a custom maze with a known path.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the custom maze and the start coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the final map with the expected map.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the setWay() method correctly sets the path in the custom maze. This is important to ensure the setWay() method can handle different mazes.

Scenario 3: Testing the setWay2 method with a custom maze

Details:  
  TestName: testSetWay2CustomMaze.
  Description: This test checks the setWay2() method with a custom maze to verify if the path is correctly set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a custom maze with a known path.
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the custom maze and the start coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the final map with the expected map.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the setWay2() method correctly sets the path in the custom maze. This is important to ensure the setWay2() method can handle different mazes.

Scenario 4: Testing the setWay method with an impossible maze

Details:  
  TestName: testSetWayImpossibleMaze.
  Description: This test checks the setWay() method with an impossible maze to verify that the method correctly identifies that no path is possible.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an impossible maze with no path from start to end.
  Act: Invoke the setWay method with the impossible maze and the start coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no path is found.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the setWay() method correctly identifies when no path is possible. This is important to ensure the method can handle edge cases.

Scenario 5: Testing the setWay2 method with an impossible maze

Details:  
  TestName: testSetWay2ImpossibleMaze.
  Description: This test checks the setWay2() method with an impossible maze to verify that the method correctly identifies that no path is possible.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an impossible maze with no path from start to end.
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the impossible maze and the start coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that no path is found.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the setWay2() method correctly identifies when no path is possible. This is important to ensure the method can handle edge cases.
