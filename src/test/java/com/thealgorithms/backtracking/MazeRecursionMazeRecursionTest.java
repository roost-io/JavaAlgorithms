"""
Scenario 1: Test mazeRecursion with the default setup

Details:  
TestName: testMazeRecursionDefaultSetup
Description: This test checks that the mazeRecursion method works as expected with the default setup. 

Execution:
Arrange: No setup is required as the mazeRecursion method does not require arguments. 
Act: Invoke the mazeRecursion method. 
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method does not throw an exception and that the method prints the expected output to the console.

Validation: 
This test verifies that the mazeRecursion method works as expected with the default setup. This is important to ensure that the method can correctly create a maze and find a path through it.

Scenario 2: Test mazeRecursion with a different maze setup

Details:  
TestName: testMazeRecursionDifferentSetup
Description: This test checks that the mazeRecursion method can handle a different maze setup. 

Execution:
Arrange: Modify the mazeRecursion method to use a different maze setup. 
Act: Invoke the modified mazeRecursion method. 
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method does not throw an exception and that the method prints the expected output to the console.

Validation: 
This test verifies that the mazeRecursion method can handle different maze setups. This is important to ensure that the method is flexible and can handle different maze configurations.

Scenario 3: Test mazeRecursion with no path through the maze

Details:  
TestName: testMazeRecursionNoPath
Description: This test checks that the mazeRecursion method can handle a maze with no path through it. 

Execution:
Arrange: Modify the mazeRecursion method to use a maze setup with no path through it. 
Act: Invoke the modified mazeRecursion method. 
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the method does not throw an exception and that the method prints the expected output to the console.

Validation: 
This test verifies that the mazeRecursion method can handle a maze with no path through it. This is important to ensure that the method can correctly identify when there is no path through the maze.
