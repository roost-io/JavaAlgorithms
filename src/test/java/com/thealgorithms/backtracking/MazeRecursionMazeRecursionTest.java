""" 
Scenario 1: Testing mazeRecursion with a default map and verifying the path tracking

Details:  
TestName: testMazeRecursionPathTracking
Description: This test checks the mazeRecursion() method for the default maze map and verifies if the path tracking works correctly by checking the map data after the method execution.
Execution:
Arrange: No arrangement is required as mazeRecursion does not take any parameter.
Act: Invoke the mazeRecursion method.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual results against expected outcomes. In this case, you can't assert as the method does not return any value and it prints the map on console.
Validation: 
This test aims to verify the correctness of the path tracking logic in mazeRecursion() method. The significance of the test lies in ensuring the method correctly sets and prints the path in the map.

Scenario 2: Testing setWay method with default map and verifying if it finds the correct path

Details:  
TestName: testSetWayPathFinding
Description: This test checks the setWay() method for the default maze map and verifies if it finds the correct path to the end of the maze.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a default map as specified in mazeRecursion method.
Act: Invoke setWay method with the map and start coordinates (1,1).
Assert: Assert that the returned value is true, indicating a path was found.
Validation: 
This test aims to verify the correctness of the path finding logic in setWay() method. The significance of the test lies in ensuring the method correctly finds a path in the map.

Scenario 3: Testing setWay2 method with default map and verifying if it finds the correct path

Details:  
TestName: testSetWay2PathFinding
Description: This test checks the setWay2() method for the default maze map and verifies if it finds the correct path to the end of the maze.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a default map as specified in mazeRecursion method.
Act: Invoke setWay2 method with the map and start coordinates (1,1).
Assert: Assert that the returned value is true, indicating a path was found.
Validation: 
This test aims to verify the correctness of the path finding logic in setWay2() method. The significance of the test lies in ensuring the method correctly finds a path in the map.

Scenario 4: Testing setWay method with a map having no path to the end

Details:  
TestName: testSetWayNoPath
Description: This test checks the setWay() method for a maze map that has no path to the end and verifies if it correctly returns false.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a map that has no path to the end.
Act: Invoke setWay method with the map and start coordinates (1,1).
Assert: Assert that the returned value is false, indicating no path was found.
Validation: 
This test aims to verify the correctness of the path finding logic in setWay() method when there is no path to the end. The significance of the test lies in ensuring the method correctly handles such scenarios and returns false.

Scenario 5: Testing setWay2 method with a map having no path to the end

Details:  
TestName: testSetWay2NoPath
Description: This test checks the setWay2() method for a maze map that has no path to the end and verifies if it correctly returns false.
Execution:
Arrange: Create a map that has no path to the end.
Act: Invoke setWay2 method with the map and start coordinates (1,1).
Assert: Assert that the returned value is false, indicating no path was found.
Validation: 
This test aims to verify the correctness of the path finding logic in setWay2() method when there is no path to the end. The significance of the test lies in ensuring the method correctly handles such scenarios and returns false.
