Scenario 1: Test combination method with valid input array and n value

Details:
  TestName: testCombinationWithValidInputs
  Description: This test is meant to check the combination method when provided with a valid array and n value. This scenario targets the normal operation of the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid array and define a valid n value.
  Act: Invoke the combination method with the created array and n value.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected combinations.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the combination method correctly generates all combinations of length n from the array. The expected result is derived from the known behavior of combination generation. This test is significant as it confirms the correctness of the method under normal operating conditions.

Scenario 2: Test combination method with n value set to 0

Details:
  TestName: testCombinationWithNValueZero
  Description: This test checks the combination method when the n value is set to 0. This scenario targets the error handling of the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array and set n value to 0.
  Act: Invoke the combination method with the created array and n value.
  Assert: Assert that the return value is null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly returns null when n is 0. The expected result is based on the method's specification that it should return null for n = 0. This test is important as it confirms the method's error handling capability.

Scenario 3: Test combination method with empty array

Details:
  TestName: testCombinationWithEmptyArray
  Description: This test checks the combination method when provided with an empty array. This scenario targets the method's handling of edge cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty array and define a valid n value.
  Act: Invoke the combination method with the created array and n value.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the combination method correctly handles an empty array input. The expected result is an empty list, as there are no elements to form combinations. This test is significant as it confirms the method's ability to handle edge cases.

Scenario 4: Test combination method with n value greater than array length

Details:
  TestName: testCombinationWithNValueGreaterThanArrayLength
  Description: This test checks the combination method when the n value is greater than the length of the array. This scenario targets the method's handling of edge cases.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array and define an n value greater than the array's length.
  Act: Invoke the combination method with the created array and n value.
  Assert: Assert that the returned list is empty.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the combination method correctly handles the case where n is greater than the array's length. The expected result is an empty list, as it's impossible to form combinations of length greater than the array's length. This test is significant as it tests the method's ability to handle edge cases.
