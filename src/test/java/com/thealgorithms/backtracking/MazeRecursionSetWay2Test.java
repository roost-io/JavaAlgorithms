"================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Unvalidated Input (CWE-20)
Issue: The function setWay2 does not validate the input parameters 'i' and 'j'. This may lead to ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException if the function is called with invalid 'i' and 'j'.
Solution: Add checks at the beginning of the function to verify 'i' and 'j' are within the valid range of the map's dimensions.

Vulnerability: Infinite Recursion (CWE-674)
Issue: There is no termination condition for the recursion if the ball can't find a path. This can lead to a StackOverflowError, causing the application to crash.
Solution: Add a termination condition for the recursion. For instance, limit the depth of the recursion or keep track of the points visited by the ball to prevent it from visiting the same point multiple times.

Vulnerability: Information Exposure (CWE-200)
Issue: The function modifies the input map directly. This could lead to information exposure if the map is used elsewhere in the application.
Solution: Copy the input map before modifying it, so the original map is not exposed.

================================================================================
""" 
Scenario 1: Test for successful path finding

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulPathFinding
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the ball can successfully find a path in the maze. The maze is set up such that a path exists and the ball should be able to find it following the strategy: up->right->down->left. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a maze with a feasible path.
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the maze and the starting coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ball has found the path (map[6][5] == 2).
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the ball has successfully found its path in the maze. The expected result is true because a feasible path is provided in the maze.

Scenario 2: Test for unsuccessful path finding

Details:  
  TestName: testUnsuccessfulPathFinding
  Description: This test is meant to check what happens when there is no feasible path in the maze. The maze is set up such that there is no path available for the ball.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a maze with no feasible path.
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the maze and the starting coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ball has found the path (map[6][5] == 2).
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the ball is unable to find a path in the maze. The expected result is false because no feasible path is provided in the maze.

Scenario 3: Test for handling of obstacles

Details:  
  TestName: testObstacleHandling
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the ball can correctly handle obstacles in the maze. The maze is set up such that there are obstacles in the way of the ball's path.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a maze with obstacles in the path.
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the maze and the starting coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ball has correctly marked the obstacles (map[i][j] == 1 for obstacle coordinates).
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the ball has correctly marked the obstacles in the maze. The expected result is true because the ball should treat the obstacles as walls and not pass through them.
  
Scenario 4: Test for handling of dead ends

Details:  
  TestName: testDeadEndHandling
  Description: This test is meant to check whether the ball can correctly handle dead ends in the maze. The maze is set up such that there are dead ends in the path of the ball.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a maze with dead ends in the path.
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the maze and the starting coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the ball has correctly marked the dead ends (map[i][j] == 3 for dead end coordinates).
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies if the ball has correctly marked the dead ends in the maze. The expected result is true because the ball should mark the dead ends and backtrack to find a new path.
