"""" 
Scenario 1: Test for successful path finding

Details:  
  TestName: successfulPathFinding.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the setWay2 method can successfully find the path for the ball from the starting point to the ending point in the maze.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D integer array to represent the maze map. The starting point is at coordinate (1,1) and the ending point is at coordinate (6,5).
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the map, and the coordinates of the starting point.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual map with the expected map after the ball traverses the maze.

Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the setWay2 method can correctly find the path for the ball in the maze. The expected result is a map with a trail of 2's from the starting point to the ending point.
  This test is significant as it ensures the core functionality of the setWay2 method, which is to find a path in the maze, works as expected.


Scenario 2: Test for handling unreachable ending point

Details:  
  TestName: unreachableEndingPoint.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the setWay2 method handles the situation when the ending point in the maze is unreachable.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D integer array to represent the maze map. The starting point is at coordinate (1,1) and the ending point is at coordinate (6,5). However, the path to the ending point is blocked by walls.
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the map, and the coordinates of the starting point.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual map with the expected map after the ball attempts to traverse the maze.

Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the setWay2 method can correctly handle the situation when the ending point is unreachable. The expected result is a map with the path the ball has taken, which ends at a dead end.
  This test is significant as it tests the error handling capability of the setWay2 method, ensuring the program does not crash or go into an infinite loop when the ending point is unreachable.


Scenario 3: Test for handling invalid starting point

Details:  
  TestName: invalidStartingPoint.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the setWay2 method handles the situation when the starting point in the maze is invalid.

Execution:
  Arrange: Create a 2D integer array to represent the maze map. The starting point is at coordinate (0,0) which is a wall, and the ending point is at coordinate (6,5).
  Act: Invoke the setWay2 method with the map, and the coordinates of the starting point.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check the return value of the setWay2 method.

Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the setWay2 method can correctly handle the situation when the starting point is invalid. The expected result is false, indicating that there is no feasible path.
  This test is significant as it tests the error handling capability of the setWay2 method, ensuring the program does not crash or behave unexpectedly when the starting point is invalid.
