"================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-400: Uncontrolled Resource Consumption ('Resource Exhaustion')
Issue: The recursive implementation of the floodFill method can lead to a StackOverflowError if the recursion depth becomes too large. This could be used to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack by forcing the application to crash.
Solution: Implement iterative flood fill algorithm using a queue or stack data structure instead of recursion. This would prevent potential StackOverflowErrors and limit resource exhaustion.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The method does not validate the 'image' parameter. If a null value is passed, a NullPointerException will be thrown. Additionally, the method does not check if the 'image' is an empty array.
Solution: Add null-check and empty-check for the 'image' parameter at the beginning of the method. Throw a custom exception or handle it according to your application's error management policy.

Vulnerability: CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types
Issue: The method does not validate the 'newColor' and 'oldColor' parameters. If these parameters are not valid color values, the method may behave unexpectedly.
Solution: Add range-check for 'newColor' and 'oldColor' parameters to ensure they are within the valid color range.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing for a 2D image with different colors and replacing a color that is present.
Details:  
  TestName: testFor2DImageWithDifferentColors
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the floodFill method when it is called with an image that has different colors and the oldColor is present in the image. It should replace all instances of the oldColor with the newColor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an image with different colors and determine the expected outcome after the color replacement.
  Act: Call the floodFill method with the image, coordinates of a pixel with the oldColor, the newColor, and the oldColor.
  Assert: Use the assertArrayEquals method to compare the image after the method call with the expected image.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that all instances of the oldColor in the image have been replaced with the newColor. This test is essential to confirm that the floodFill method accurately fills the image with the newColor.

Scenario 2: Testing for a 2D image with different colors and replacing a color that is not present.
Details:  
  TestName: testFor2DImageWithAbsentColor
  Description: This test is meant to validate the floodFill method's behavior when it is called with an image that contains different colors, and the oldColor is not present in the image. The image should remain unchanged.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an image with different colors and determine the expected outcome after the color replacement attempt.
  Act: Call the floodFill method with the image, coordinates of a pixel, the newColor, and an oldColor that is not present in the image.
  Assert: Use the assertArrayEquals method to compare the image after the method call with the expected image.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the image remains unchanged when the oldColor is not present in the image. This test is important to ensure that the floodFill method does not alter the image when it should not.

Scenario 3: Testing for a 2D image with the same color and replacing the color.
Details:  
  TestName: testFor2DImageWithSameColor
  Description: This test is designed to check the functionality of the floodFill method when it is called with an image that has the same color for all pixels. It should replace the color of all pixels with the newColor.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an image with the same color for all pixels and determine the expected outcome after the color replacement.
  Act: Call the floodFill method with the image, coordinates of a pixel, the newColor, and the oldColor.
  Assert: Use the assertArrayEquals method to compare the image after the method call with the expected image.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the color of all pixels in the image has been replaced with the newColor. This test is essential to confirm that the floodFill method accurately fills the image with the newColor.

Scenario 4: Testing for an empty image.
Details:  
  TestName: testForEmptyImage
  Description: This test is meant to validate the floodFill method's behavior when it is called with an empty image. The image should remain empty.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty image and determine the expected outcome after the method call.
  Act: Call the floodFill method with the empty image, any coordinates, any newColor, and any oldColor.
  Assert: Use the assertArrayEquals method to compare the image after the method call with the expected image.
Validation: 
  The assertion checks that the image remains empty when the method is called with an empty image. This test is important to ensure that the floodFill method does not alter the image when it should not.
