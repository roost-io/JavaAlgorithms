""""
Scenario 1: Testing for a 2D image with different colors and replacing a color that is present.
 
Details:  
  TestName: testForColorReplacementIn2DImage.
  Description: This test aims to validate the functionality of the floodFill method when used on a 2D image with various colors and the target color for replacement is present within the image.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D image with multiple colors including the old color for replacement.
  Act: Invoke the floodFill method on the image with the coordinates of the old color and provide the new color for replacement.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual image after replacement against the expected image.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the old color in the image has been accurately replaced with the new color. The expected result is derived from the manual replacement of the old color with the new color in the image. This test is significant as it checks the core functionality of the floodFill method.

Scenario 2: Testing for a 2D image with different colors and replacing a color that is not present.

Details:  
  TestName: testForNonExistentColorReplacementIn2DImage.
  Description: This test aims to validate the functionality of the floodFill method when used on a 2D image with various colors and the target color for replacement is not present within the image.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D image with multiple colors excluding the old color for replacement.
  Act: Invoke the floodFill method on the image with the coordinates of the old color and provide the new color for replacement.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual image after attempted replacement against the expected image.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the image remains unchanged after an attempt to replace a non-existent color. The expected result is the same as the original image since the old color for replacement is not present in the image. This test is significant as it checks the robustness of the floodFill method.

Scenario 3: Testing for a 2D image with the same color throughout and replacing the color with a new one.

Details:  
  TestName: testForUniformColorReplacementIn2DImage.
  Description: This test aims to validate the functionality of the floodFill method when used on a 2D image with a uniform color and the target color for replacement is present within the image.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D image with a uniform color which is the old color for replacement.
  Act: Invoke the floodFill method on the image with any coordinates and provide the new color for replacement.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual image after replacement against the expected image.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the old color in the image has been accurately replaced with the new color throughout the image. The expected result is an image with a uniform new color. This test is significant as it checks the floodFill method's ability to replace all occurrences of a color in the image.

Scenario 4: Testing for a 2D image with new color same as the old color.

Details:  
  TestName: testForSameNewAndOldColorIn2DImage.
  Description: This test aims to validate the functionality of the floodFill method when used on a 2D image and the new color for replacement is the same as the old color.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D image with various colors including the old color for replacement.
  Act: Invoke the floodFill method on the image with the coordinates of the old color and provide the new color for replacement which is the same as the old color.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual image after attempted replacement against the expected image.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the image remains unchanged after an attempt to replace a color with the same color. The expected result is the same as the original image since the new color is the same as the old color. This test is significant as it checks the floodFill method's ability to handle such scenarios without causing any changes to the image.

Scenario 5: Testing for a 2D image with invalid coordinates.

Details:  
  TestName: testForInvalidCoordinatesIn2DImage.
  Description: This test aims to validate the functionality of the floodFill method when used on a 2D image and the coordinates provided for color replacement are invalid.
Execution:
  Arrange: A 2D image with various colors including the old color for replacement.
  Act: Invoke the floodFill method on the image with invalid coordinates and provide the new color for replacement.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual image after attempted replacement against the expected image.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies if the image remains unchanged after an attempt to replace a color at invalid coordinates. The expected result is the same as the original image since the coordinates provided are invalid. This test is significant as it checks the floodFill method's ability to handle such scenarios without causing any changes to the image.
