"""
Scenario 1: Test when all nodes can be painted with given colors.
  
Details:  
  TestName: testAllNodesCanBePainted.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method accurately determines if all nodes can be painted with given colors. The target scenario is where there are enough colors to paint all nodes without violating the condition that adjacent nodes should have different colors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Nodes where each Node has a list of edges representing adjacent nodes. Set 'n' as the total number of nodes and 'm' as the number of available colors.
  Act: Invoke possiblePaint method with the ArrayList, 'n', and 'm' as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is 1, indicating that all nodes can be painted with the given colors.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly determines if all nodes can be painted without violating the condition. This test is significant as it verifies the functionality of the method under normal conditions where there are enough colors available.

Scenario 2: Test when not all nodes can be painted with given colors.

Details:  
  TestName: testNotAllNodesCanBePainted.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method accurately determines if not all nodes can be painted with given colors. The target scenario is where there are not enough colors to paint all nodes without violating the condition that adjacent nodes should have different colors.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an ArrayList of Nodes where each Node has a list of edges representing adjacent nodes. Set 'n' as the total number of nodes and 'm' as a number less than the required number of colors.
  Act: Invoke possiblePaint method with the ArrayList, 'n', and 'm' as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is 0, indicating that not all nodes can be painted with the given colors.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly determines if not all nodes can be painted due to insufficient colors. This test is significant as it verifies the functionality of the method under conditions where there are not enough colors available.

Scenario 3: Test when there are no nodes to paint.

Details:  
  TestName: testNoNodesToPaint.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method accurately handles the scenario where there are no nodes to paint.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty ArrayList of Nodes. Set 'n' as 0 and 'm' as any number.
  Act: Invoke possiblePaint method with the ArrayList, 'n', and 'm' as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned value is 1, indicating that all nodes (none in this case) can be painted with the given colors.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles the scenario where there are no nodes to paint. This test is significant as it verifies the functionality of the method under edge conditions.
