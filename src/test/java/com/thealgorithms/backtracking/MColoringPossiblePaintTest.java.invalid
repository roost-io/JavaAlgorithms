  Scenario 1: Test the graph coloring when all nodes are connected and the number of colors is enough.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringAllNodesConnectedEnoughColors.
    Description: This test is designed to check the graph coloring functionality when all nodes are connected and the number of colors available is enough to color all nodes without violating the rule of adjacent nodes having different colors. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where all nodes are connected and the number of colors is equal to the number of nodes.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph and the number of colors.
    Assert: Assert that the return value of the method is 1, indicating that it is possible to color the graph.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the graph coloring method can correctly determine whether it is possible to color a graph when the number of colors is enough. The expected result is based on the rule that adjacent nodes should have different colors. This test is significant as it checks the basic functionality of the graph coloring method.

  Scenario 2: Test the graph coloring when all nodes are connected and the number of colors is not enough.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringAllNodesConnectedNotEnoughColors.
    Description: This test is designed to check the graph coloring functionality when all nodes are connected and the number of colors available is not enough to color all nodes without violating the rule of adjacent nodes having different colors. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where all nodes are connected and the number of colors is less than the number of nodes.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph and the number of colors.
    Assert: Assert that the return value of the method is 0, indicating that it is not possible to color the graph.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the graph coloring method can correctly determine whether it is possible to color a graph when the number of colors is not enough. The expected result is based on the rule that adjacent nodes should have different colors. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the graph coloring method.

  Scenario 3: Test the graph coloring when not all nodes are connected.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringNotAllNodesConnected.
    Description: This test is designed to check the graph coloring functionality when not all nodes are connected. In such a scenario, even a single color might be enough to color the graph. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where not all nodes are connected.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph and the number of colors.
    Assert: Assert that the return value of the method is 1, indicating that it is possible to color the graph.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the graph coloring method can correctly determine whether it is possible to color a graph when not all nodes are connected. The expected result is based on the rule that adjacent nodes should have different colors. This test is significant as it checks the ability of the graph coloring method to handle different types of graphs.

  Scenario 4: Test the graph coloring when the graph is empty.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringEmptyGraph.
    Description: This test is designed to check the graph coloring functionality when the graph is empty. In such a scenario, the result should be 1 as there are no nodes to color.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty graph.
    Act: Invoke the possiblePaint method with the created graph and the number of colors.
    Assert: Assert that the return value of the method is 1, indicating that it is possible to color the graph.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the graph coloring method can correctly handle an empty graph. The expected result is based on the rule that adjacent nodes should have different colors. This test is significant as it checks the error handling capability of the graph coloring method.
