"================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')
Issue: In the code provided, the ArrayList 'visited' is being populated without checking the size of the input. This could lead to a buffer overflow if the input size exceeds the capacity of the ArrayList.
Solution: Implement a check to ensure the size of the input does not exceed the capacity of the ArrayList. Consider using a data structure with dynamic size adjustment or implement exception handling for ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.

Vulnerability: CWE-362: Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition')
Issue: The code does not seem to handle concurrent execution properly. If multiple threads access and manipulate the 'visited' ArrayList or the 'nodes' ArrayList simultaneously, it could lead to inconsistent data and race conditions.
Solution: Use synchronization techniques to ensure that only one thread can access the shared resources at a time. Java provides several ways to synchronize your code such as synchronized blocks, synchronized methods, or by using locks and semaphores from the java.util.concurrent.locks package.

Vulnerability: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference
Issue: The code does not check if 'nodes' ArrayList contains a null value before accessing its elements. This could lead to a Null Pointer Exception if any element in 'nodes' is null.
Solution: Always check if an object is not null before dereferencing it. A null check can prevent Null Pointer Exception from being thrown at runtime.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test the graph coloring when all nodes are connected and the number of colors is enough.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithEnoughColors.
    Description: This test is designed to check if the method can correctly handle the situation where all nodes are connected and the number of colors is sufficient to color all nodes without any two adjacent nodes having the same color. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where all nodes are connected and specify the number of colors as the number of nodes.
    Act: Invoke the target method with the created graph and the specified number of colors.
    Assert: Expect the method to return 1, indicating that it is possible to color the graph with the given number of colors.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that it is possible to color a fully connected graph with as many colors as there are nodes. This test is significant because it checks the method's ability to handle the ideal scenario where there are enough colors to paint all nodes.

  Scenario 2: Test the graph coloring when all nodes are connected but the number of colors is not enough.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithInsufficientColors.
    Description: This test checks if the method can correctly handle the situation where all nodes are connected but the number of colors is less than the number of nodes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where all nodes are connected and specify the number of colors as less than the number of nodes.
    Act: Invoke the target method with the created graph and the specified number of colors.
    Assert: Expect the method to return 0, indicating that it is not possible to color the graph with the given number of colors.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that it is not possible to color a fully connected graph with less colors than nodes. This test is significant because it checks the method's ability to handle the scenario where there are not enough colors to paint all nodes.

  Scenario 3: Test the graph coloring when the graph is not fully connected and the number of colors is less than the number of nodes.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithDisconnectedNodes.
    Description: This test checks if the method can correctly handle the situation where the graph is not fully connected and the number of colors is less than the number of nodes.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a graph where not all nodes are connected and specify the number of colors as less than the number of nodes.
    Act: Invoke the target method with the created graph and the specified number of colors.
    Assert: Expect the method to return 1, indicating that it is possible to color the graph with the given number of colors.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that it is possible to color a partially connected graph with less colors than nodes. This test is significant because it checks the method's ability to handle the scenario where there are disconnected nodes in the graph.

  Scenario 4: Test the graph coloring when the graph is empty.

  Details:  
    TestName: testGraphColoringWithEmptyGraph.
    Description: This test checks if the method can correctly handle the situation where the graph is empty.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an empty graph and specify any number of colors.
    Act: Invoke the target method with the created graph and the specified number of colors.
    Assert: Expect the method to return 1, indicating that it is possible to color the graph with the given number of colors.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method correctly identifies that it is possible to color an empty graph with any number of colors. This test is significant because it checks the method's ability to handle the scenario where the graph is empty.
