"""
Scenario 1: Test with valid positive integers for n and k

Details:  
  TestName: testValidPositiveIntegers.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method correctly generates all combinations of 1 to n of length k when both n and k are valid positive integers. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set n and k as valid positive integers.
  Act: Invoke the combination method with n and k as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected combinations.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly generates all combinations of 1 to n of length k. The expected result is based on the fundamental principle of combinations. This test is crucial to confirm that the method works as expected with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test with k greater than n

Details:  
  TestName: testKGreaterThanN.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles the scenario where k is greater than n, which is not logically possible in combinations. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set n as a smaller positive integer than k.
  Act: Invoke the combination method with n and k as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected outcome, which should be an empty list.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the scenario where k is greater than n by returning an empty list. This test is important to ensure the method's robustness against illogical inputs.

Scenario 3: Test with n equals 0

Details:  
  TestName: testNEqualsZero.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles the scenario where n equals 0, which means there are no elements to form combinations from. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set n as 0 and k as any positive integer.
  Act: Invoke the combination method with n and k as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the scenario where n equals 0 by returning null. This test is important to ensure the method's robustness against edge case inputs.

Scenario 4: Test with k equals 0

Details:  
  TestName: testKEqualsZero.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles the scenario where k equals 0, which means the length of combinations should be 0.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set n as any positive integer and k as 0.
  Act: Invoke the combination method with n and k as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the scenario where k equals 0 by returning null. This test is important to ensure the method's robustness against edge case inputs.

Scenario 5: Test with negative integers for n and k

Details:  
  TestName: testNegativeIntegers.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method handles the scenario where n and k are negative integers, which is not logically possible in combinations. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set n and k as negative integers.
  Act: Invoke the combination method with n and k as parameters.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly handles the scenario where n and k are negative integers by returning null. This test is important to ensure the method's robustness against invalid inputs.
