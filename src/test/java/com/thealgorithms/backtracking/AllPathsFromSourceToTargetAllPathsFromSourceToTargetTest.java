"================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code does not seem to have any debug information, but it's always important to ensure that no debug information is left in production code. Debug information can expose sensitive information about the application, its logic, or data.
Solution: Always ensure to remove all debug code or information before the application is moved to production. Use logging frameworks to control what information should be logged and when.

Vulnerability: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
Issue: The function allPathsFromSourceToTarget takes several parameters but does not validate them. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors.
Solution: Add validation checks for all inputs. Ensure they are within expected ranges and are of the correct type. Null checks are also recommended.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: Although not directly visible in this code, if any part of your program uses random values for security purposes (e.g., generating keys or nonces), using java.util.Random is insecure because it is not cryptographically strong.
Solution: Use java.security.SecureRandom for generating secure random values.

Vulnerability: CWE-404: Improper Resource Shutdown or Release
Issue: It's not clear from this snippet if any resources (like database connections, network sockets, file handles, etc.) are used, but if they are, improper handling can lead to resource leaks.
Solution: Use try-with-resources statement for automatic resource management in Java.

"""
Scenario 1: Testing allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a null graph.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNullGraph.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a null graph. A null graph is passed as the input parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: A null graph is created.
  Act: The method allPathsFromSourceToTarget is invoked with the null graph as the parameter.
  Assert: An IllegalArgumentException is expected to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method can correctly handle a null graph, which is an invalid input. The expected result is an IllegalArgumentException, as it is conventionally thrown when a method is passed invalid arguments.

Scenario 2: Testing allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a graph with negative vertices.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNegativeVertices.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a graph with negative vertices. A graph with negative vertices is passed as the input parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: A graph with negative vertices is created.
  Act: The method allPathsFromSourceToTarget is invoked with the graph as the parameter.
  Assert: An IllegalArgumentException is expected to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method can correctly handle a graph with negative vertices, which is an invalid input. The expected result is an IllegalArgumentException, as it is conventionally thrown when a method is passed invalid arguments.

Scenario 3: Testing allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a graph with no edges.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNoEdges.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a graph with no edges. A graph with no edges is passed as the input parameter.
Execution:
  Arrange: A graph with no edges is created.
  Act: The method allPathsFromSourceToTarget is invoked with the graph as the parameter.
  Assert: An empty list is expected to be returned.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method can correctly handle a graph with no edges. The expected result is an empty list, as there are no paths from the source to the target in a graph with no edges.

Scenario 4: Testing allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a source vertex that doesn't exist in the graph.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNonExistentSourceVertex.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a graph where the source vertex doesn't exist. A graph and a non-existent source vertex are passed as the input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: A graph and a non-existent source vertex are created.
  Act: The method allPathsFromSourceToTarget is invoked with the graph and the non-existent source vertex as the parameters.
  Assert: An IllegalArgumentException is expected to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method can correctly handle a graph where the source vertex doesn't exist. The expected result is an IllegalArgumentException, as it is conventionally thrown when a method is passed invalid arguments.

Scenario 5: Testing allPathsFromSourceToTarget with a destination vertex that doesn't exist in the graph.

Details:  
  TestName: testWithNonExistentDestinationVertex.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the method can handle a graph where the destination vertex doesn't exist. A graph and a non-existent destination vertex are passed as the input parameters.
Execution:
  Arrange: A graph and a non-existent destination vertex are created.
  Act: The method allPathsFromSourceToTarget is invoked with the graph and the non-existent destination vertex as the parameters.
  Assert: An IllegalArgumentException is expected to be thrown.
Validation: 
  This test is meant to verify that the method can correctly handle a graph where the destination vertex doesn't exist. The expected result is an IllegalArgumentException, as it is conventionally thrown when a method is passed invalid arguments.
