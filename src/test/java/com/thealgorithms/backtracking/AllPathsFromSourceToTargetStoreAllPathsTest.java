Based on the provided information, here are several test scenarios for the `storeAllPaths` method in the `AllPathsFromSourceToTarget` class:

```
Scenario 1: Test with a Simple Graph

Details:
  TestName: simpleGraphWithOnePath
  Description: Test the storeAllPaths method with a simple graph containing one path from source to destination.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with 3 vertices and edges 0->1->2.
  Act: Call storeAllPaths(0, 2).
  Assert: Verify that nm contains one path [0, 1, 2].
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method correctly identifies and stores a single path in a simple linear graph. It ensures the basic functionality of path finding works as expected.

Scenario 2: Test with Multiple Paths

Details:
  TestName: graphWithMultiplePaths
  Description: Test the storeAllPaths method with a graph containing multiple paths from source to destination.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with 4 vertices and edges 0->1, 0->2, 1->3, 2->3.
  Act: Call storeAllPaths(0, 3).
  Assert: Verify that nm contains two paths [0, 1, 3] and [0, 2, 3].
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can identify and store all possible paths when multiple routes exist between the source and destination.

Scenario 3: Test with No Path

Details:
  TestName: graphWithNoPath
  Description: Test the storeAllPaths method when there is no path from source to destination.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with 3 vertices and edges 0->1, 2->1.
  Act: Call storeAllPaths(0, 2).
  Assert: Verify that nm is empty.
Validation:
  This test verifies that the method correctly handles cases where no path exists between the source and destination, ensuring nm remains empty.

Scenario 4: Test with Source and Destination as Same Node

Details:
  TestName: sourceAndDestinationSameNode
  Description: Test the storeAllPaths method when the source and destination are the same node.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with 3 vertices and any edges.
  Act: Call storeAllPaths(1, 1).
  Assert: Verify that nm contains one path [1].
Validation:
  This test checks if the method correctly handles the edge case where the source and destination are the same, expecting a single-node path.

Scenario 5: Test with Cyclic Graph

Details:
  TestName: cyclicGraph
  Description: Test the storeAllPaths method with a graph containing cycles.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with 4 vertices and edges 0->1, 1->2, 2->3, 3->1.
  Act: Call storeAllPaths(0, 3).
  Assert: Verify that nm contains the correct paths without infinite loops.
Validation:
  This test ensures that the method can handle cyclic graphs without getting stuck in infinite recursion and still find all valid paths.

Scenario 6: Test with Large Graph

Details:
  TestName: largeGraph
  Description: Test the storeAllPaths method with a large graph to check performance and correctness.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a graph with a significant number of vertices and edges.
  Act: Call storeAllPaths with source and destination at opposite ends of the graph.
  Assert: Verify that nm contains all expected paths and the execution completes within a reasonable time.
Validation:
  This test checks the method's performance and correctness when dealing with larger, more complex graphs, ensuring it scales well.
```

These test scenarios cover various aspects of the `storeAllPaths` method, including basic functionality, multiple paths, edge cases, and potential issues like cycles and performance with larger graphs. They aim to thoroughly validate the method's behavior in different situations.
