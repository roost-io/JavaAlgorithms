================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: The code does not seem to use any random values, but if it does in other parts, Java's built-in random number generators are not suitable for security-sensitive operations as they can be predictable.
Solution: Use java.security.SecureRandom instead of java.util.Random when generating random values for security-sensitive operations.

Vulnerability: CWE-489: Leftover Debug Code
Issue: The code does not seem to contain any debug information, but if it does in other parts, leaving debug code in production software can expose system information or functionality that is useful to an attacker.
Solution: Ensure that debug code is not included in the production version of the software.

Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: While not evident in the provided code, if sensitive information is passed through GET request query strings in other parts, it can be logged in various places such as browser history, web server logs, and network appliances that handle the HTTP request.
Solution: Do not expose sensitive information via HTTP GET request query strings.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: SQL Injection
Issue: If the application interacts with a database, and SQL queries are not constructed securely, it can lead to SQL Injection.
Solution: Use prepared statements with parameterized queries, or use ORM libraries to interact with the database securely.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify if the method stores all paths correctly from source to destination

Details:  
TestName: testStoreAllPathsCorrectly
Description: This test is meant to check if the storeAllPaths method is able to correctly store all possible paths from a given source to a destination in a graph.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of AllPathsFromSourceToTarget class. Initialize the adjacency list and add edges to create a graph.
Act: Invoke the storeAllPaths method with appropriate source and destination vertices.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual list of all paths from source to destination against the expected list.
Validation: 
The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly stores all the possible paths from source to destination. The expected result is based on the graph structure created. This test is significant as it checks the core functionality of the method.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the method's behavior when source and destination vertices are the same

Details:  
TestName: testStoreAllPathsForSameSourceDestination
Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the storeAllPaths method when the source and destination vertices are the same.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of AllPathsFromSourceToTarget class. Initialize the adjacency list and add edges to create a graph.
Act: Invoke the storeAllPaths method with the same source and destination vertices.
Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual list of all paths from source to destination against the expected list.
Validation: 
The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly handles the scenario where source and destination are the same. The expected result in this case is a list containing a single path, from the vertex to itself. This test is significant as it checks the method's edge case behavior.

Scenario 3: Test to verify the method's behavior with a non-existing vertex

Details:  
TestName: testStoreAllPathsWithNonExistingVertex
Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the storeAllPaths method when a non-existing vertex is provided as source or destination.
Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of AllPathsFromSourceToTarget class. Initialize the adjacency list and add edges to create a graph.
Act: Invoke the storeAllPaths method with a non-existing vertex as source or destination.
Assert: Catch the expected exception.
Validation: 
The assertion aims to verify if the method correctly handles the scenario where a non-existing vertex is provided. The expected result is an exception, as a non-existing vertex cannot be a valid source or destination. This test is significant as it checks the method's error handling capabilities.
