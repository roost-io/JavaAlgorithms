"""
Scenario 1: Validate the correct color at the given coordinates
TestName: validateColorAtGivenCoordinates
Description: This test is meant to check if the method getPixel returns the correct color at the given x and y coordinates of the image.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a 2D image array with known color values. Define the x and y coordinates for which the color is to be obtained.
  Act: Invoke the getPixel method with the image array and the defined x and y coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned color with the expected color at the given coordinates.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the color returned by the getPixel method is as expected. This is significant as it validates the functionality of the method in retrieving the correct color at the given coordinates.

Scenario 2: Validate the behavior when x and y coordinates are out of bounds
TestName: validateOutOfBoundsCoordinates
Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getPixel method when the provided x and y coordinates are out of the image bounds.
Execution:
  Arrange: Initialize a 2D image array with known color values. Define the x and y coordinates that are out of the array bounds.
  Act: Invoke the getPixel method with the image array and the out of bounds x and y coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown when trying to access an element out of bounds. This is significant as it validates the robustness of the method in handling such error scenarios.

Scenario 3: Validate the behavior with a null image
TestName: validateNullImage
Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the getPixel method when the provided image is null.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a null image. Define any x and y coordinates.
  Act: Invoke the getPixel method with the null image and the defined x and y coordinates.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect a NullPointerException.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that a NullPointerException is thrown when trying to access an element in a null array. This is significant as it validates the robustness of the method in handling such error scenarios.
