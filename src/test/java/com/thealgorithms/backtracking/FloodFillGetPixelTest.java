Scenario 1: Validate the correct color at the given coordinates
  Details:
    TestName: validateCorrectPixelColor
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPixel method returns the correct color at the given coordinates.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a 2D image array and set a known color at a specific coordinate.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with the coordinates of the known color.
    Assert: Assert that the returned color matches the known color set in the image.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getPixel method correctly retrieves the color at the specified coordinates. The expected result is the color that was initially set at these coordinates. This test is significant for ensuring the correct functionality of the getPixel method.

Scenario 2: Test for out of bounds coordinates
  Details:
    TestName: testOutOfBoundsCoordinates
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getPixel method throws an exception when given coordinates that are out of bounds.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a 2D image array with known dimensions.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with coordinates that are outside the image's dimensions.
    Assert: Assert that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getPixel method throws an exception when the given coordinates are outside the boundaries of the image. The expected result is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. This test is significant for ensuring robust error handling in the getPixel method.

Scenario 3: Test for negative coordinates
  Details:
    TestName: testNegativeCoordinates
    Description: This test is designed to check if the getPixel method throws an exception when given negative coordinates.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a 2D image array with known dimensions.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with negative coordinates.
    Assert: Assert that an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getPixel method throws an exception when the given coordinates are negative. The expected result is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException. This test is significant for ensuring robust error handling in the getPixel method.

Scenario 4: Test for zero coordinates
  Details:
    TestName: testZeroCoordinates
    Description: This test is designed to validate that the getPixel method returns the correct color at the origin (0,0).
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a 2D image array and set a known color at the origin.
    Act: Call the getPixel method with zero coordinates.
    Assert: Assert that the returned color matches the known color set at the origin.
  Validation: 
    This test verifies that the getPixel method correctly retrieves the color at the origin. The expected result is the color that was initially set at the origin. This test is significant for ensuring the correct functionality of the getPixel method when dealing with zero coordinates.
