"""
Scenario 1: Test to check if the sum function returns correct count when valid numbers are passed

Details:  
  TestName: testSumWithValidNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the sum function is able to correctly compute the count of ways a number can be expressed as the sum of the power of unique natural numbers given a valid n, x and i.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a PowerSum object. Set n, x and i to valid numbers.
  Act: Invoke the sum function using the PowerSum object with the set n, x and i.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected count.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the sum function correctly computes the count. The expected result is based on the mathematical calculation of the problem. This test is significant in ensuring the sum function works as expected with valid input numbers.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the sum function handles zero correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSumWithZero
  Description: This test is meant to check if the sum function is able to handle zero correctly, as zero raised to any power except zero is always zero.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a PowerSum object. Set n, x or i to zero.
  Act: Invoke the sum function using the PowerSum object with the set n, x and i.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected count.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the sum function correctly handles zero. The expected result is based on the mathematical fact that zero raised to any power except zero is always zero. This test is significant in ensuring the sum function works as expected when zero is an input.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the sum function handles negative numbers correctly

Details:  
  TestName: testSumWithNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check if the sum function is able to handle negative numbers correctly, as raising a negative number to any power can result in a positive or negative number.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a PowerSum object. Set n, x or i to negative numbers.
  Act: Invoke the sum function using the PowerSum object with the set n, x and i.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected count.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the sum function correctly handles negative numbers. The expected result is based on the mathematical fact that raising a negative number to any power can result in a positive or negative number. This test is significant in ensuring the sum function works as expected when negative numbers are inputs.
