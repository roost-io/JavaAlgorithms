"""
Scenario 1: Test the process method with valid sample and coefficients

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessWithValidSampleAndCoefficients.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the process method correctly processes the input sample using the provided coefficients. The coefficients are set to valid non-zero values and the sample is a valid double value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the coefficients using the setCoeffs method. The input sample is a valid double value.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the input sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the process method correctly processes the input sample using the provided coefficients. This test is significant as it checks the core functionality of the IIRFilter.

Scenario 2: Test the process method with zero as input sample

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessWithZeroSample.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the process method correctly handles the case where the input sample is zero. The coefficients are set to valid non-zero values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the coefficients using the setCoeffs method. The input sample is zero.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the input sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the process method correctly handles the case where the input sample is zero. This test is significant as it checks the edge case where the input sample is zero.

Scenario 3: Test the process method with coefficients not set

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessWithCoefficientsNotSet.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the process method correctly handles the case where the coefficients are not set. The input sample is a valid double value.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not set the coefficients. The input sample is a valid double value.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the input sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the process method correctly handles the case where the coefficients are not set. This test is significant as it checks the error handling of the process method.

Scenario 4: Test the process method with negative input sample

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessWithNegativeSample.
  Description: The test is meant to check if the process method correctly processes the input sample when it is a negative value. The coefficients are set to valid non-zero values.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the coefficients using the setCoeffs method. The input sample is a negative double value.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the input sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the process method correctly processes the input sample when it is a negative value. This test is significant as it checks the edge case where the input sample is negative.
