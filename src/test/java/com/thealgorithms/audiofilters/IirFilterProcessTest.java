Here are the generated test scenarios for the `process` method:
**Scenario 1: Happy Path with Non-Zero Coefficients**
Details:
TestName: testProcessWithNonZeroCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with non-zero coefficients and a valid sample value.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the object with order=2, coeffsA=[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], coeffsB=[4.0, 5.0, 6.0], historyX=[0.0, 0.0], and historyY=[0.0, 0.0]. Set the sample value to 10.0.
Act: Invoke the `process` method with the sample value.
Assert: Verify that the returned result is not zero and is calculated correctly based on the coefficients and sample value.
Validation:
This test aims to verify that the `process` method correctly applies the filter coefficients to the sample value and returns a non-zero result. The expected result is calculated based on the provided coefficients and sample value. This test is significant because it ensures the core functionality of the `process` method works as expected.
**Scenario 2: Zero Coefficients**
Details:
TestName: testProcessWithZeroCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with zero coefficients and a valid sample value.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the object with order=2, coeffsA=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], coeffsB=[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], historyX=[0.0, 0.0], and historyY=[0.0, 0.0]. Set the sample value to 10.0.
Act: Invoke the `process` method with the sample value.
Assert: Verify that the returned result is zero.
Validation:
This test aims to verify that the `process` method correctly handles zero coefficients and returns a zero result. The expected result is zero because the coefficients are all zero. This test is significant because it ensures the `process` method behaves correctly in this edge case.
**Scenario 3: Invalid Order**
Details:
TestName: testProcessWithInvalidOrder
Description: Test the `process` method with an invalid order value.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the object with order=-1, coeffsA=[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], coeffsB=[4.0, 5.0, 6.0], historyX=[0.0, 0.0], and historyY=[0.0, 0.0]. Set the sample value to 10.0.
Act: Invoke the `process` method with the sample value.
Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown or an error occurs.
Validation:
This test aims to verify that the `process` method correctly handles an invalid order value and throws an exception or returns an error. The expected result is an exception or error because the order value is invalid. This test is significant because it ensures the `process` method behaves correctly in this edge case.
**Scenario 4: Null Coefficients**
Details:
TestName: testProcessWithNullCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with null coefficients.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the object with order=2, coeffsA=null, coeffsB=null, historyX=[0.0, 0.0], and historyY=[0.0, 0.0]. Set the sample value to 10.0.
Act: Invoke the `process` method with the sample value.
Assert: Verify that an exception is thrown or an error occurs.
Validation:
This test aims to verify that the `process` method correctly handles null coefficients and throws an exception or returns an error. The expected result is an exception or error because the coefficients are null. This test is significant because it ensures the `process` method behaves correctly in this edge case.
**Scenario 5: Sample Value of Zero**
Details:
TestName: testProcessWithZeroSample
Description: Test the `process` method with a sample value of zero.
Execution:
Arrange: Initialize the object with order=2, coeffsA=[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], coeffsB=[4.0, 5.0, 6.0], historyX=[0.0, 0.0], and historyY=[0.0, 0.0]. Set the sample value to 0.0.
Act: Invoke the `process` method with the sample value.
Assert: Verify that the returned result is zero.
Validation:
This test aims to verify that the `process` method correctly handles a sample value of zero and returns a zero result. The expected result is zero because the sample value is zero. This test is significant because it ensures the `process` method behaves correctly in this edge case.
I hope these test scenarios cover all the possible cases for the `process` method!
