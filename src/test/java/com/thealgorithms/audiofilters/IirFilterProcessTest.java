Here are some test scenarios for the `process` method of the `IIRFilter` class:

**Scenario 1: Process a sample with default coefficients**

Details:
TestName: processSampleWithDefaultCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with default coefficients and a sample value.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` with default coefficients.
Act: Call the `process` method with a sample value, e.g., 1.0.
Assert: Verify that the returned value is not NaN (Not a Number) and is within a reasonable range.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle a sample value with default coefficients. The expected result should be a processed sample value that is not NaN and is within a reasonable range.

**Scenario 2: Process a sample with custom coefficients**

Details:
TestName: processSampleWithCustomCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with custom coefficients and a sample value.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` and set custom coefficients using the `setCoeffs` method.
Act: Call the `process` method with a sample value, e.g., 1.0.
Assert: Verify that the returned value is not NaN and is within a reasonable range.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle a sample value with custom coefficients. The expected result should be a processed sample value that is not NaN and is within a reasonable range.

**Scenario 3: Process multiple samples with default coefficients**

Details:
TestName: processMultipleSamplesWithDefaultCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with default coefficients and multiple sample values.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` with default coefficients.
Act: Call the `process` method multiple times with different sample values, e.g., 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.
Assert: Verify that the returned values are not NaN and are within a reasonable range.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle multiple sample values with default coefficients. The expected result should be processed sample values that are not NaN and are within a reasonable range.

**Scenario 4: Process multiple samples with custom coefficients**

Details:
TestName: processMultipleSamplesWithCustomCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with custom coefficients and multiple sample values.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` and set custom coefficients using the `setCoeffs` method.
Act: Call the `process` method multiple times with different sample values, e.g., 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.
Assert: Verify that the returned values are not NaN and are within a reasonable range.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle multiple sample values with custom coefficients. The expected result should be processed sample values that are not NaN and are within a reasonable range.

**Scenario 5: Edge case - Sample value is NaN**

Details:
TestName: processSampleValueIsNaN
Description: Test the `process` method with a sample value that is NaN.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` with default coefficients.
Act: Call the `process` method with a sample value that is NaN.
Assert: Verify that the returned value is NaN.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle a sample value that is NaN. The expected result should be NaN.

**Scenario 6: Edge case - Sample value is Infinity**

Details:
TestName: processSampleValueIsInfinity
Description: Test the `process` method with a sample value that is Infinity.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` with default coefficients.
Act: Call the `process` method with a sample value that is Infinity.
Assert: Verify that the returned value is Infinity.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle a sample value that is Infinity. The expected result should be Infinity.

Note that these test scenarios are not exhaustive, and you may need to add more test scenarios to cover all the edge cases and error handling. Additionally, you will need to implement the test code using JUnit to validate these test scenarios.
