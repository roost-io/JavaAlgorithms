Here are some test scenarios for the `process` method of the `IIRFilter` class:

**Scenario 1: Process a sample with default coefficients**

Details:
TestName: processSampleWithDefaultCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with default coefficients and a sample value.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` with default coefficients.
Act: Call the `process` method with a sample value, e.g., 1.0.
Assert: Verify that the returned value is not NaN (Not a Number) and is within a reasonable range.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle a sample value with default coefficients. The expected result should be a processed sample value that is not NaN and is within a reasonable range.

**Scenario 2: Process a sample with custom coefficients**

Details:
TestName: processSampleWithCustomCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with custom coefficients and a sample value.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` and set custom coefficients using the `setCoeffs` method.
Act: Call the `process` method with a sample value, e.g., 1.0.
Assert: Verify that the returned value is not NaN and is within a reasonable range.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle a sample value with custom coefficients. The expected result should be a processed sample value that is not NaN and is within a reasonable range.

**Scenario 3: Process multiple samples with default coefficients**

Details:
TestName: processMultipleSamplesWithDefaultCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with default coefficients and multiple sample values.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` with default coefficients.
Act: Call the `process` method multiple times with different sample values, e.g., 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.
Assert: Verify that the returned values are not NaN and are within a reasonable range.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle multiple sample values with default coefficients. The expected result should be processed sample values that are not NaN and are within a reasonable range.

**Scenario 4: Process multiple samples with custom coefficients**

Details:
TestName: processMultipleSamplesWithCustomCoefficients
Description: Test the `process` method with custom coefficients and multiple sample values.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` and set custom coefficients using the `setCoeffs` method.
Act: Call the `process` method multiple times with different sample values, e.g., 1.0, 2.0, 3.0.
Assert: Verify that the returned values are not NaN and are within a reasonable range.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle multiple sample values with custom coefficients. The expected result should be processed sample values that are not NaN and are within a reasonable range.

**Scenario 5: Edge case - Sample value is NaN**

Details:
TestName: processSampleValueIsNaN
Description: Test the `process` method with a sample value that is NaN.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` with default coefficients.
Act: Call the `process` method with a sample value that is NaN.
Assert: Verify that the returned value is NaN.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle a sample value that is NaN. The expected result should be NaN.

**Scenario 6: Edge case - Sample value is Infinity**

Details:
TestName: processSampleValueIsInfinity
Description: Test the `process` method with a sample value that is Infinity.

Execution:
Arrange: Create an instance of `IIRFilter` with default coefficients.
Act: Call the `process` method with a sample value that is Infinity.
Assert: Verify that the returned value is Infinity.

Validation:
This test verifies that the `process` method can handle a sample value that is Infinity. The expected result should be Infinity.

Note that these test scenarios are not exhaustive, and you may need to add more test scenarios to cover all the edge cases and error handling. Additionally, you will need to implement the test code using JUnit to validate these test scenarios.

/*
The test function `processSampleWithCustomCoefficients` is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` that is thrown when calling the `setCoeffs` method of the `IIRFilter` class. The error message indicates that the `aCoeffs` array must be of size 2, but an array of size 3 is being passed.

The issue is that the `IIRFilter` class has a check in the `setCoeffs` method that ensures the size of the `aCoeffs` array matches the order of the filter. In this case, the order of the filter is 2, but the `aCoeffs` array being passed has a size of 3.

To fix this issue, the `aCoeffs` array should be resized to match the order of the filter, which is 2. The correct `aCoeffs` array should be `{ 1.0, 2.0 }` instead of `{ 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 }`. Similarly, the `bCoeffs` array should also be resized to match the order of the filter.

Additionally, the test function should be updated to ensure that the `aCoeffs` and `bCoeffs` arrays are correctly sized before calling the `setCoeffs` method. This can be done by adding a check before calling the `setCoeffs` method to ensure that the arrays are the correct size.

The test is failing due to an `IllegalArgumentException` being thrown from the `setCoeffs` method of the `IIRFilter` class. The error message indicates that the `aCoeffs` array must be of size 2, but an array of size 3 was passed.

The issue lies in the test method `processMultipleSamplesWithCustomCoefficients` where an array of size 3 is being passed to the `setCoeffs` method: `double[] coeffsA = { 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 };`. The size of the array should be 2, not 3, to match the order of the filter which is set to 2 in the line `IIRFilter filter = new IIRFilter(2);`.

To fix the test, the size of the `coeffsA` array should be reduced to 2, for example: `double[] coeffsA = { 1.0, 2.0 };`.
