Scenario 1: Test for processing a valid sample

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessValidSample
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly processes a valid sample and returns the expected result. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a valid sample and the coefficients arrays.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the valid sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the process method correctly processes a valid sample. The expected result is based on the logic of the method. This test is significant in ensuring that the method works as expected with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test for processing a sample with zero coefficients

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessZeroCoefficients
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly handles a scenario where the coefficients are zero. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a sample and the coefficients arrays with zero values.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the sample.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException as the first coefficient should not be zero.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the process method correctly throws an exception when it encounters a zero coefficient. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles edge cases correctly.

Scenario 3: Test for processing a sample with negative coefficients

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessNegativeCoefficients
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly processes a sample with negative coefficients.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a sample and the coefficients arrays with negative values.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the sample.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the actual result against the expected result.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the process method correctly processes a sample with negative coefficients. The expected result is based on the logic of the method. This test is significant in ensuring that the method works correctly with negative coefficients.

Scenario 4: Test for processing a sample with coefficients of different sizes

Details:  
  TestName: testProcessDifferentSizeCoefficients
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method process correctly handles a scenario where the coefficients arrays are of different sizes. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a sample and the coefficients arrays of different sizes.
  Act: Invoke the process method with the sample.
  Assert: Expect an IllegalArgumentException as the coefficients arrays should be of the same size.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the process method correctly throws an exception when it encounters coefficients arrays of different sizes. This test is significant in ensuring that the method handles error scenarios correctly.
