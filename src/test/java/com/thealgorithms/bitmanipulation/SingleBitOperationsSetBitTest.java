""" 
Scenario 1: Test to validate the setBit method with a positive number and a valid bit position

Details:  
  TestName: testSetBitWithPositiveNumberAndValidBitPosition
  Description: This test will validate the functionality of the setBit method when a positive number and a valid bit position are provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a num variable with a positive integer value and a bit position within the range of the integer's binary representation. 
    Act: Invoke the setBit method by passing the num and bit position.
    Assert: Compare the result of the method with the expected output, which is the num with the bit at the specified bit position set to 1.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the setBit method correctly sets the bit at the given bit position in the num to 1. This test is significant to ensure the setBit method works correctly with valid inputs.

Scenario 2: Test to validate the setBit method with a negative number

Details:  
  TestName: testSetBitWithNegativeNumber
  Description: This test will validate the functionality of the setBit method when a negative number is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a num variable with a negative integer value and a bit position within the range of the integer's binary representation. 
    Act: Invoke the setBit method by passing the num and bit position.
    Assert: Compare the result of the method with the expected output, which is the num with the bit at the specified bit position set to 1.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the setBit method correctly sets the bit at the given bit position in the num to 1, regardless of the sign of the num. This test is significant to ensure the setBit method works correctly with negative numbers.

Scenario 3: Test to validate the setBit method with a bit position out of range

Details:  
  TestName: testSetBitWithOutOfRangeBitPosition
  Description: This test will validate the functionality of the setBit method when a bit position out of the range of the num's binary representation is provided. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a num variable with an integer value and a bit position out of the range of the num's binary representation. 
    Act: Invoke the setBit method by passing the num and bit position.
    Assert: Compare the result of the method with the expected output, which is the num unchanged since the bit position is out of range.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the setBit method correctly leaves the num unchanged when the bit position is out of range. This test is significant to ensure the setBit method handles out-of-range bit positions correctly.
