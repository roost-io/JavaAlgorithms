"""
Scenario 1: Test with two positive numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testWithTwoPositiveNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when two positive numbers are passed as parameters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as we are directly passing the values.
    Act: Invoke the method with two positive numbers, for example, 5 and 10.
    Assert: Since both numbers are positive, the result should be false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies the signs of the numbers. The expected result is false because both numbers are positive.

Scenario 2: Test with two negative numbers
Details:  
  TestName: testWithTwoNegativeNumbers
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when two negative numbers are passed as parameters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as we are directly passing the values.
    Act: Invoke the method with two negative numbers, for example, -5 and -10.
    Assert: Since both numbers are negative, the result should be false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies the signs of the numbers. The expected result is false because both numbers are negative.

Scenario 3: Test with one positive and one negative number
Details:  
  TestName: testWithOnePositiveAndOneNegativeNumber
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when one positive and one negative number are passed as parameters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as we are directly passing the values.
    Act: Invoke the method with one positive and one negative number, for example, 5 and -10.
    Assert: Since one number is positive and the other is negative, the result should be true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies the signs of the numbers. The expected result is true because the numbers have different signs.

Scenario 4: Test with zero and a positive number
Details:  
  TestName: testWithZeroAndPositiveNumber
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when zero and a positive number are passed as parameters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as we are directly passing the values.
    Act: Invoke the method with zero and a positive number, for example, 0 and 10.
    Assert: Since zero is neither positive nor negative, the result should be false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies the signs of the numbers. The expected result is false because zero is neither positive nor negative.

Scenario 5: Test with zero and a negative number
Details:  
  TestName: testWithZeroAndNegativeNumber
  Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the method when zero and a negative number are passed as parameters.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as we are directly passing the values.
    Act: Invoke the method with zero and a negative number, for example, 0 and -10.
    Assert: Since zero is neither positive nor negative, the result should be false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion aims to verify that the method correctly identifies the signs of the numbers. The expected result is false because zero is neither positive nor negative.
